# Basic Sentiment NLP Analysis
 NLP work
### The basic idea around this project was to figure out how to download financial reports to local. Select a random sample and combine with CRSP data to calculate CAR 0, +/-1, +/-2, +/-3, +/-5. We would then perform sentiment analysis on reports filed for companies and how CAR changed or didn't changed based on the new information released in the document.
